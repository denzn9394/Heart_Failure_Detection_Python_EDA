The heart failure dataset contains 299 observations with 13 features related to patient demographics, clinical measurements, and health conditions. Key attributes include age, anaemia status, creatinine 
phosphokinase levels, diabetes status, ejection fraction, high blood pressure, platelet count, serum creatinine, serum sodium, sex, smoking status, follow-up period, and whether the patient experienced a 
death event. Using Python, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize the proportions of anaemic, diabetic, hypertensive, smoking, and sex-specific patient groups through pie charts. 
Bar plots were used to examine the relationship between these conditions and the death event, revealing significant correlations. Correlation heatmaps provided insight into the relationships between 
different features. For predictive modeling, the dataset was split into training and testing sets, and features were standardized using the StandardScaler. I applied various machine learning models, 
including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), to predict heart failure outcomes. Each model's performance 
was evaluated using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports, with visual representations of confusion matrices created using heatmaps. This comprehensive approach highlighted the 
most effective models for predicting heart failure and identified key factors influencing patient outcomes.
The heart failure dataset analysis began with data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and ensure consistency across the dataset. Key statistical summaries were generated to provide an 
overview of the dataset, highlighting central tendencies and variability in patient attributes. The exploratory data analysis (EDA) included generating pie charts to depict the proportions of patients 
with anaemia, diabetes, high blood pressure, and smoking habits, offering a clear visualization of the distribution of these conditions.
Bar plots further illustrated the impact of these conditions on the mortality rate, revealing that certain factors like high blood pressure and anaemia were strongly associated with higher death rates. 
A comprehensive correlation analysis using a heatmap identified significant relationships between features, such as the inverse correlation between ejection fraction and death events, indicating that 
lower ejection fraction values were linked to higher mortality.
For predictive modeling, the dataset was divided into training and test sets using a 75-25 split, and feature scaling was performed to standardize the data. Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, 
Decision Tree, and kNN models were trained and evaluated. The Random Forest Classifier emerged as the most accurate model, achieving an accuracy of approximately 85%, followed by SVM and Logistic 
Regression with slightly lower accuracies.
Confusion matrices for each model provided detailed insights into the classification performance, showing the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. Feature importance 
analysis from the Random Forest model highlighted age, ejection fraction, and serum creatinine as critical predictors of heart failure outcomes. This analysis not only aided in model selection but also 
provided actionable insights for healthcare professionals to prioritize monitoring and interventions for high-risk patients. The project's thorough approach ensured robust model validation and emphasized 
the importance of specific health indicators in heart failure prognosis.
In conclusion, the heart failure detection project effectively utilized exploratory data analysis and various machine learning models to predict patient outcomes. The analysis revealed that key factors 
such as age, ejection fraction, and serum creatinine levels are critical predictors of heart failure mortality. Among the models tested, the Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy, 
highlighting its potential for reliable predictions. Visualizations and statistical summaries provided valuable insights into the distribution and impact of health conditions on heart failure. 
This project underscores the importance of data-driven approaches in improving heart failure prognosis and patient management strategies.
